The Auto Weighted Player is an attempt to make a music player
that brings up your favourite songs more often, and ones that
you skip less often. The interface isn't really fleshed out yet,
but the core concept is that you have a playlist where each song
has a weighting, and songs are chosen randomly according to that weighting.

The playlist file has the following format:
WEIGHT (float) \t VOLUME (0. - 1.) \t PATH
Each line is an entry, and ordering is ignored.

This project makes use of the excellent gevent library for python (http://gevent.org),
as well as baudm's mplayer.py library (http://github.com/baudm/mplayer.py).
